The bones are the skeletons' money. In our world, bones equal dollars. That's why they're
coming out tonight to get their bones from you. The skeletons will pull your hair. Up, but
not out. All they want is another chance at life. They've never seen so much food as this. 
Underground, there's half as much food as this and the worms are their money. The bones are 
their dollars.
